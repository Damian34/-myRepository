Here are 2 projects from studies about mobile applications:

### kalkulator ###
api that work like scientific calculator. 
how far i remember, I based it on my own scientific calculator with similar gui.
so the input can be string expression like "((1+1)*(1+1))+2" and in result give result supporting brackets etc.

### przelicznik ###
in short it is api to convert currency value into another.
I am not sure now but this api probably use external rest api to get actual currency values.
